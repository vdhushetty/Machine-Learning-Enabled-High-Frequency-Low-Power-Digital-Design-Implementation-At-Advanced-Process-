Design Implementation At Advanced Process Nodes"

Welcome to the Readme file

The models were exectued in python IDE.
1. The code is present in the file named python.
2. The dataset is available in 2 places, Data and python as xlsx and csv.
3. The scripts used to extract data is also available in the DATA folder.

6. Install the required libraries. It depends on the libraries you have.
   so run the code and see which libraries are absent in your device.
7. The designs the data was extracted from ae present in the Design file.
8. The plots results are available in the Results folder.
9. The Report and PPT can be found in the parent directory. If you are 
   reading this then you have already found readme.txt (captain obvious)
The dataet and codes are also in the link that can be found in the report
